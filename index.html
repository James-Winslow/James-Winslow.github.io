 <!-- About -->
<article id="about">
    <h2 class="major">About</h2>
    <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="About Image" /></span>
    <p> Hey there! I'm Jimmy, a data scientist who combines strategic thinking, technical expertise, and communication skills to solve complex challenges in research and business.</p>

    <h2>Laying the Foundation: My Undergraduate Years</h2>
    <p>My journey into data science began at Gonzaga University, where I studied Mathematics and Biology. During my time there, I conducted ecology research that led to publication, exploring the effects of environmental factors on snails. It was a hands-on experience—I spent days in the field collecting samples and analyzing data in the lab. This taught me the value of planning and the transformative power of data in understanding the natural world.</p>
    
    <p>Beyond academics, I developed essential communication and leadership skills. Improv comedy taught me to think quickly, embrace uncertainty, and collaborate creatively, while leading retreats gave me experience organizing events and connecting with people. These activities shaped my ability to adapt, communicate, and lead, skills that have been invaluable in my career.</p>
    
    <h2>From Advocacy to Analytics</h2>
    <p>After college, I joined the <strong>Tennessee Justice Center</strong> as a Community Organizer, advocating for patients and building support for Medicaid expansion. This role challenged me to craft narratives that resonated with diverse audiences and adapt strategies in a fast-paced policy environment. Working with people from opposing viewpoints taught me flexibility and empathy—qualities that continue to shape my approach to problem-solving.</p>
    
    <h2>Graduate School: Deepening My Expertise</h2>
    <p>Pursuing a <strong>Master of Public Health (MPH) in Biostatistics</strong> at the University of Colorado Denver allowed me to deepen my expertise in statistical methods. As a Teaching Assistant, I taught graduate-level Statistics, refining my ability to communicate complex ideas in ways that resonate with diverse audiences. This experience reinforced my belief in the power of data as a tool for meaningful decision-making.</p>
    
    <h2>Applying Knowledge in Research and Healthcare</h2>
    <p>At the <strong>VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System</strong>, I applied my statistical skills to clinical research. This role involved designing studies, analyzing complex datasets, and collaborating with doctors to ensure findings translated into actionable insights. I also gained experience in grant writing and manuscript preparation, strengthening both my technical and communication skills.</p>
    
    <h2>Advancing in Data Science</h2>
    <p>At the <strong>University of Colorado School of Medicine</strong>, I worked as a Data Scientist, developing predictive models to improve patient outcomes. This role required me to expand beyond statistics, integrating machine learning and application development into my work. Bridging the gap between technical experts and non-technical stakeholders became a critical part of delivering impactful solutions.</p>
    
    <h2>Mastering Data Engineering at Arisant</h2>
    <p>Most recently, at <strong>Arisant</strong>, I refined my data engineering skills, building data pipelines and dashboards while applying machine learning to solve business problems. Collaborating with data engineers and government partners, I combined technical expertise with strategic thinking to deliver impactful solutions that meet complex analytical needs.</p>
    
    <h2>Looking Ahead: My Future Goals</h2>
    <p>I’m excited to continue advancing in data science, focusing on machine learning and data engineering. My goal is to tackle challenging problems in industries that have a meaningful impact on people’s lives. I’m committed to lifelong learning and am eager to explore emerging technologies that will shape the future of data science.</p>
