            <!-- About -->
            <article id="about">
                <h2 class="major">About</h2>
                <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="About Image" /></span>
                <p>I am <strong>Jimmy Winslow</strong>, a data scientist with a deep passion for combining strategic thinking, statistical knowledge, and communication skills to tackle complex challenges in both research and business environments.</p>

                <h2>Laying the Foundation: My Undergraduate Years</h2>
                <p>My journey into the world of data and research began during my undergraduate studies at Gonzaga University, where I pursued degrees in Mathematics and Biology. It was here that I first applied statistics in a practical setting, conducting ecology research that led to publication. My work, which involved studying the effects of environmental factors on snails, not only deepened my understanding of biology but also taught me the importance of rigorous planning and the research process. This experience was uniquely hands-on—I spent many days outdoors, collecting snails and fishing, before returning to the lab to analyze the data. This early exposure to research solidified my appreciation for how knowledge is generated and the critical role that data plays in shaping our understanding of the natural world.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond the lab, my time in college was also enriched by activities that built my communication and leadership skills. I immersed myself in improvisational comedy, an experience that taught me the value of thinking on my feet, embracing uncertainty, and collaborating creatively with others. Research shows that improv strengthens quick decision-making, enhances active listening, and fosters adaptability—skills that have been invaluable in my professional life. Additionally, I led numerous retreats, honing my ability to organize events, guide discussions, and inspire groups. These experiences laid the groundwork for the strong communication, leadership, and adaptability skills I would later apply in my career.</p>
                
                <h2>From Advocacy to Analytics: Building on My Early Experiences</h2>
                <p>After college, I transitioned into a role as a <strong>Community Organizer</strong> for the Tennessee Justice Center, where I worked on patient advocacy and developed community support for Medicaid expansion. Here, I leveraged the strategic thinking and communication skills I had developed in college to craft compelling narratives that resonated with diverse audiences. I learned to be flexible in my approach, adapting strategies quickly in the fast-paced world of policy and politics. This experience reinforced my ability to work effectively with both my team and those who held opposing views, a skill that has proven invaluable in every role I have taken on since.</p>
                
                <h2>Graduate School: Deepening My Expertise in Statistics and Teaching</h2>
                <p>Pursuing a <strong>Master of Public Health (MPH) in Biostatistics</strong> at the University of Colorado Denver marked the next major phase of my journey. My graduate education was rigorous, focusing on advanced statistical methods and consulting. During this time, I also served as a <strong>Teaching Assistant</strong>, where I taught Statistics at the graduate level. This experience demonstrated my ability to communicate complex subjects to a diverse set of students from various educational backgrounds and ability levels. Teaching required not only a deep understanding of the material but also the ability to break down intricate concepts into understandable lessons, demonstrating my patience, adaptability, and commitment to helping others succeed. This period was pivotal in refining my technical expertise and solidifying my commitment to using data as a tool for impactful decision-making.</p>
                
                <h2>Applying Knowledge in Research and Healthcare</h2>
                <p>Following graduate school, I joined the <strong>VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System</strong>, where I applied my statistical expertise to support clinical research. In this role, I gained extensive experience with data warehousing, study design, and the development of complex analyses. My work also involved grant writing and manuscript preparation, where I collaborated closely with doctors to ensure that our research could translate into actionable insights. This experience not only strengthened my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of how to communicate complex data-driven findings to non-technical audiences.</p>
                
                <h2>Advancing in Data Science: Merging Research with Business</h2>
                <p>My next role took me to the <strong>University of Colorado School of Medicine</strong>, where I worked as a Data Scientist. Here, I applied my statistical knowledge to solve business problems in healthcare, developing predictive models that improved patient outcomes. This position required me to expand my skill set beyond traditional statistics, as I learned to build applications and integrate machine learning models into business processes. My consulting and communication skills were critical, as I needed to bridge the gap between technical experts and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring that our solutions were both technically sound and practically useful.</p>
                
                <h2>Mastering Data Engineering at Arisant</h2>
                <p>Most recently, at <strong>Arisant</strong>, I further refined my data science skills by delving into data engineering and warehousing. I became proficient in building data pipelines and developed extensive SQL skills to support our engineering efforts. My work involved applying machine learning techniques to solve business challenges and collaborating closely with data engineers and government partners to create dashboards that met their analytical needs. This role allowed me to integrate all the skills I’ve developed throughout my career—strategic thinking, technical expertise, and effective communication—to deliver results that make a meaningful impact.</p>
                
                <h2>Looking Ahead: My Future Goals</h2>
                <p>As I look to the future, I am eager to continue advancing in the field of data science, with a particular focus on the intersection of machine learning and data engineering. I aspire to tackle complex problems that require innovative solutions, particularly in industries that have a significant impact on people's lives. I aim to refine my expertise in building scalable data systems and applying advanced analytics to drive business growth and improve decision-making processes. Personally, I am committed to lifelong learning and am excited to explore emerging technologies and methodologies that will shape the future of data science.</p>
