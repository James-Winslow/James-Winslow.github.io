                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Hi, I'm Jimmy and I currently live in the Seattle area. My journey in the field of data science and statistics has been a rich and fulfilling adventure, marked by a passion for uncovering truths through data.</p>
                <p>I began my academic career at Gonzaga University, where I pursued a dual degree in Mathematics (BS) and Biology (BA). The rigorous curriculum and diverse subjects ignited my curiosity and equipped me with a solid foundation in quantitative analysis and scientific research. After completing my undergraduate studies, I dedicated a year to volunteer service at the Tennessee Justice Center. Here, I worked as a Community Outreach Coordinator, where I educated underinsured and uninsured clients about insurance eligibility. This experience honed my skills in communication and advocacy, and deepened my understanding of the social impacts of healthcare policies.</p>
                <p>Driven by a desire to specialize further, I enrolled in the University of Colorado Denver's graduate program, where I earned my Master of Public Health (MPH) in Biostatistics. This program refined my ability to analyze complex data sets and reinforced my commitment to public health and biostatistics.</p>
                <p>My professional journey began at the VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System as a Statistician. I conducted analyses of longitudinal and survival data from clinical studies, which expanded the number of active studies for our biostatistics team by 20%. I developed analytic plans and reports for physicians in various specialties, and I became adept at using SQL, SAS, and R to manage and analyze data from diverse sources. I then transitioned to the University of Colorado School of Medicine, where I worked as a Data Scientist. I designed and deployed an R Shiny application to evaluate surgical risk, which significantly increased its user base among surgical partners. Through collaboration and feedback integration, I improved the surgical risk prediction model, reducing errors by 15%.</p>
                <p>Most recently, I served as a Data Scientist at Arisant, where I designed and implemented an analysis pathway for the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, reducing errors by 15%. I managed diverse databases, built custom data pipelines, and created machine learning models to predict customer churn, enhancing client success and retention.</p>
                <p>As I continue to develop my data science and statistics skills, my goal is to make a meaningful contribution to my field, particularly in the realm of AI and large language models (LLMs). I am passionate about discovering the truth and combating misinformation through rigorous data analysis. I hope to leverage my expertise to help both the public and private sectors approach data with integrity and precision. I am eager to stay at the forefront of the rapidly evolving data landscape and to use my skills to make a positive impact. Whether through advancing public health initiatives or driving innovation in technology, my commitment to uncovering truth and promoting data-driven decision-making remains steadfast.</p>
